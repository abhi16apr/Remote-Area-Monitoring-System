Painless mesh:

  - connected 3 nodes - 2 regular and 1 aggregator
  - tested node in the middle communication
      - far node out of range from aggregator
      - middle node powered on connected to aggregator
      - far node picked up connection through middle to aggregator
  - Any network topology change takes time - approx. 3 mins average
  - each node has a node id that may be used as an address to send direct messages
  - JSON variable will be useful for sensor data
  - there is a method to pass arguments to send message using lambda
      - look though examples on painlessMesh
  - Needed additional asyncTCP library - manually cloned from github - see ref links

Capacitive Soil Sensor:
  - ADC max on ESP 32 is 4095 - min is 0
  - SN1: Current draw: 5.66mA
  - SN4: Current draw: 5.64mA
  - SN1: Dry measurement ~2800 counts
  - SN1: Damp Paper towel measurement ~ 1500 counts

BME280:
  - Used Adafruit library - specify the address as 0x76 in bme.begin(0x76)
  - Current: 0.45mA
  - Saw some issues where other unpowered devices would be detected / prevent
    detection of other devices
  - Pressure measured 1019.9 - actual 1020 hPa
  - Temperature measured 78F - actual ~73F
  - Humidity measured 42% - actual ~50%


Compass
  - current: 1.05mA
  - the compass reference point is the tip of the y arrow
  - azimuth = 0-360 degrees


Ultrasonic Anemometer
  - Why did we leave it?
    - when measuring the voltage on the output there is only a 700mv delta
      this difference is not much more than the noise on the signal
    - the output filters out the AC sin wave to produce a DC voltage
    - If the amplitude of the signal is larger it may let more noise through
    - Inconsistent readings


Rotary Position Sensor
  - Melexis
  - 4.5mm max separation distance from supplied magnet to guide ring

Hall Effect Wind Speed Sensor
  - use interrupts to count the pulses
  - interrupts are very sensitive to noise
  - noisy digital signal causes higher than expected count

Camera
  - process for reverse engineering ArduCam Software
      1. Load serial logger modified example on cam arduino
      2. Open ArduCam windows ui and open com port
      3. select settings in arducam and capture
      4. close com port in ArduCam
      5. open com port in Arduino serial monitor
      6. send a -1 to the arduino
      7. take note of the logged bytes in decimal form
      8. convert bytes to hex
      9. serial write hex bytes using python

 --- Testing Notes ---
04/04/22
  Melexis Position Sensor
    - voltage divider is not functioning as expected
    - measures greater than 4v into analog pin on arduino

  Hall Speed Sensor
    - Pulses count is higher than expected
    - calculating rpm as (pulses / 2) * 60 -> pulses = pulses per second
    - Suspect noise on square wave causing issues
